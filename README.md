# Maven-standalone-app
This is my first standalone application project structure build using Maven

PREREQUISITES:
Java Development Kit (JDK) version 17 or later (download from https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)
Maven version 3.8.6 or later (download from https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)

CONCEPT:
MAVEN
1. What it is: Maven is an open-source software project management and comprehension tool. It's primarily written in Java, but can be used for projects in various languages.
2. What it does: Maven automates many tasks involved in software development, especially for Java projects. These tasks include:
3. Building the project: Compiling source code, packaging it into executable files (JARs for Java), and managing dependencies (libraries your project needs).
4. Dependency management: Maven helps you easily find and download the libraries your project needs from a central repository (like Maven Central) or other repositories. It also ensures you're using compatible versions of libraries to avoid conflicts.
5. Documentation generation: Maven can automatically generate documentation for your project based on comments in your code.
6. Project reporting: Maven provides reports on various aspects of your project, such as the build status, dependencies used, and unit test results.
7. Benefits of using Maven:
8. Standardized project structure: Makes it easier for developers familiar with Maven to work on your project.
9. Simplified builds: Automates repetitive tasks, saving you time and effort.
10. Dependency management: Ensures consistent and compatible library versions across your project.
11. Improved project reporting: Provides valuable insights into your project's build status and dependencies.

STANDALONE APPLICATION
1. What it is: A standalone application is a software program that can run on a computer system without requiring an external server or additional components. It's self-contained and has everything it needs to function, including the executable code, libraries, and resources.
2. Examples of standalone applications:
Text editors (e.g., Notepad, Sublime Text)
Media players (e.g., VLC Media Player, Windows Media Player)
Games (e.g., Solitaire, Minecraft)
Productivity tools (e.g., Microsoft Office, Adobe Photoshop)

STEPS:
1. Open your terminal from the folder where you have to create the project folder structure.
2. Enter the following bash code
   mvn archetype:generate \
  -DgroupId=com.yourcompany \  # Replace with your company's group ID
  -DartifactId=your-application-name \  # Replace with your application's name
  -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart \
  -DinteractiveMode=false
3. This will create an .jar folder which can be deployed on any application hosting platform. 

PROJECT STRUCTURE:
The project is organized as follows:

src/main/java: Contains the source code for your application logic.
src/main/resources: Stores configuration files or other resources needed by the application.
src/test/java: Holds unit tests for your application code.
pom.xml: Defines the project configuration, dependencies, and build lifecycle.
target: This directory is generated during the build process and contains the compiled class files and the final JAR file (my-awesome-app.jar) for running the application.
